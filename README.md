# dotonpaper 
A diary mood tracking and note-taking desktop application.

![snaptshot](/images/paper-snaps.gif) ![themecolor](/images/paper-theme-snaps.gif)
## How it works
- Each dot (aka circle) represent a day. 
- **Single click** on (circle or text) to select mood color and **single click** to fill today's dot with the selected mood.
- Each day is linked to its paper, a free-to-draw-on area, **double click** on any dot to open its paper.

#### To add text note
1. Left click + `shift` key. 
2. Start writing.

~~As long as you didn't click the mouse down after finishing wrting, you still can move the text over the paper by holding the `shift` key agin and drag the text.~~

#### Export papers
To export paper as an image, click on the upper-left corner icon (see the title bar?)

#### Edit mood names and colors
The first time you use the application, mood names and their colors can be changed by (**double clicking**) the name.
