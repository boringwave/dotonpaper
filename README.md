# dotonpaper

A desktop application for mood tracking and daily notes. 

## How it works
- Each dot represents a day of the year. To track your mood, fill today's dot with the selected mood (**single click**) from the mood list. 
- Each day is linked to its paper, a free-to-draw-on area, **double click** on any dot to open its paper.
- For general-purpose papers, kindly click on the `add button`. These papers are not linked to any day and can be acced from the papers menu (toggle menu to see)
