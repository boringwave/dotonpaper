A desktop application for mood tracking and daily notes.
![snaptshot](/images/snap.gif)
## How it works
- Each dot represents a day. To track your mood, fill today's dot with the selected mood (**single click**) from the mood list. 
- Each day is linked to its paper, a free-to-draw-on area, **double click** on any dot to open its paper.
- For general-purpose papers, click on the `add` button. These papers are not linked to any day and can be accessed from the papers menu (toggle menu to see)
